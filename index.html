	<p>	<font color="#f5f5f5">I grew up in Dunwoody, Georgia. In this Atlanta suburb, I lived at home 
		as an only child with my parents, Laura and Quinn. I grew up with a golden 
		retreiver named Rascal who, sadly, passed away this August at the age of 12. 
		I grew up playing sports such as football, soccer, golf, and baseball, however, football was my first love. Recently, my Intramural football team won Mens' competitive championship. I attended Marist High School from the 7th to 12th grade before I applied
		and was eventually accepted to the University of Georgia. I received my acceptance early, so I made it through the college application process without having to write a single essay. I grew up a 
		die-hard bulldog fan my entire life, so getting into Georgia was a dream come true. I'm a .
		sophomore in the Terry School of Business, and I hope to graduate with a BBA in Finance. I hope to work in my home city of Atlanta after college.</font></p></div>
